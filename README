Welcome to L.


If you want to have a look at some of the first language features, see
the test/ subdirectory.  

You should definitely read the documentation in the doc/ directory; it
is a good introduction to the concepts of the language.

The source is in src/; beware, it is not yet cleaned, nor optimised
(many parts are even naive).  The emphasis has been on simplicity, so
that L can quickly be self hosting.

L is a cool language to hack with, please consider contributing! If
you do, then say so in the mailing list, along with the parts that
you'd like to begin hacking (or if you don't know, just tell what you
can do, especially what languages you know, and I can give you a
project that fits you well).

Enjoy!

Notes: a recent version of the autotools is needed. 

To install, use autoreconf -f -i -s, then the usual ./configure && make.

This will create a L executable in src/L, that you can test with the
test/directory.
